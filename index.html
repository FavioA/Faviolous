                <p>
                    My name is Favio Amezcua. I was born in Bellflower, California. I was raised in Hungtington Park,
                    CA, and I attended the city's public schools. Ever since I was a Fifth Grade student, my dream was
                    to attend the Univsersity of California, Los Angeles. I attended UCLA from 1996 through 2001. During
                    my time at UCLA, I obtained a major in Latin American Studies with a concentration in
                    Ethnomusicology, along with a minor in Spanish Literature.

                    I always wanted to work in a field in which I could help people. So, after graduating I worked for
                    the Social Security Administration as a Social Insurance Specialist taking applications and
                    adjuticating claims for Supplementtal Security Income for approximately one year. After which I
                    decided that I wanted to help people in a different way. I had always enjoyed working with children,
                    so I decided to return to school to obtain a teaching credential. I obtained my Multiple Subject
                    Teaching Credential from National University in 2005. I have taught grades 3-6 since then.
                </p>

                    I enjoy doing many things outside of work. I'm a huge Los Angeles teams sports fan. Therefore,
                    logically my favorite teams are the Dodgers, Lakers, and the Rams. At the collegiate level I root
                    for my UCLA Bruins. I also enjoy listening to many different genres of music, but some of my
                    favorites are Ragtime, early Jazz, Big Band Jazz, Bebop, Afro-Cuban Jazz, and Salsa among others. I
                    not only enjoy listening to music, but I also read and play music. My main instrument is saxophone,
                    but I also learned how to play trumpet from my father. I thoroughly enjoy playing many of the same
                    genres I listen to. I consider myself a watch "geek" or "nerd" as well. My love for watches started
                    when I was in 4th Grade. I am fascinated by their different styles and functionality. I currently
                    have collection of about 50 watches of all kinds and brands. My parents gave me my first watch when
                    I was approximately 9 years old and I still have it.
